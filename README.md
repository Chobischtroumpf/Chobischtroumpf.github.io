# Welcome on my github pages
here you will be able to find links to different projects I've worked on, as well as the notes I've taken during my time at [ULB](www.ulb.be).

## Projects:
### Personal projects:
- [Libft](https://github.com/Chobischtroumpf/libft): Reimplementation of some of the most commonly used functions in the C STDLIB. the goal of this project was to get familiarised with the C programming language.
- [LibASM](https://github.com/Chobischtroumpf/libasm): Reimplementation in Assembler of some of the most commonly used functions in the C STDLIB. the goal of this project was to get familiarised with the Assembly programming language.
- [Cub3D](https://github.com/Chobischtroumpf/cub3D): A simpler Wolfenstein 3d/Doom implemented in C.
- [Webserv](https://github.com/Chobischtroumpf/webserv): CPP webserver, works in a similar fashion than Nginx, only the Get/Post/Delete are supported.
### University related projects:
- [Belgian Transit pathfinder](https://github.com/Chobischtroumpf/BETransitPathfinder): A Java based CLI program that finds the optimal path from any given public transport stop to any other stop in belgium, given a departure time for the trip
  This project was made in the context of the [Algorithms 2](https://www.ulb.be/fr/programme/info-f203-1) course, the goal was to implement Dijkstra's algorithm, or A*, using simplified GTFS data from the major transit actors in belgium.
  it was done by [Mihuu](https://github.com/MihaiStreames) and myself.
- [ULB.Frogger](https://github.com/Chobischtroumpf/ULB.Frogger): A CPP remake of the 1980's classic arcade game Frogger.
  This project was made for the [Object Oriented Programming](https://www.ulb.be/fr/programme/info-f202-1) course, in collaboration with [Heragon](https://github.com/Heraghon).
- [Battleship](https://github.com/Chobischtroumpf/Bataille-Navale-Projet-Informatique-2): CPP implementation of the Battleship game, usable in both GUI and TUI mode, and allows for online games.
  This project was made in the context of the [2nd year's project](https://www.ulb.be/fr/programme/info-f209-1) course, in collaboration with 7 other students.
- [Deezify](https://github.com/Chobischtroumpf/Deezify): A Javafx based music and radio player, with a basic equalizer, three languages, playlists and more!
  This project was made in the context of the [Software Engineering](https://www.ulb.be/fr/programme/2024-info-f307) course, with the help of 9 other students.
